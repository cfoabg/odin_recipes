    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 1 hour.</li>

        <li>Transfer beef bones and onion halves to a large stockpot. Add ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and 4 quarts water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.</li>
